[ general ]

fix inherit values for config variables
- values are hardcoded in botijo.py (or <module>.py for each module)
- botijo.conf can overlay them but should inherit the others
- command line args can overlay them and also should inherit de others

toggle visibility for some modules
- for example for syslog module it would be fine to have a config
  variable like this:
  visibility = public (or private) 

use alternate pidfile from config variables
- pidfile is hardcoded to /var/run/botijo.pid and we must be able to use
  an alternate one

improve modules initialization to be homogeneous
- all modules enabled should be initialized before the main loop 

admin privileges from modules ?
- some modules like 'notes' may require admin privileges and ATM these
  checks are from the main botijo.py and should be done in every module
- when create instances of modules we can pass the user and the list of admins


[ module log ]

avoid logging for modules petitions or use a config variable to select this
- something like '!sysinfo uname' must not be logged
- response for '!sysinfo uname' also must not be logged

add more log formats instead of having only the logtype variable:
- logtext   = 1 # default
- loghtml   = 0
- logsqlite = 0
